// 2.	Write a program that has a class with a dynamically allocated character array as its data member. One object should contain "Engineers are" and another should contain " Creatures of logic". Member function join() should concatenate two strings by passing two objects as arguments. Display the concatenated string through a member function. Use constructors to allocate and initialize the data member. Also, write a destructor to free the allocated memory for the character array. Make your own function for the concatenation of two strings.


#include <iostream>
#include<cstring>
using namespace std;
class dma
{
char *c;
int len;
public:
dma()
{
    len=0;
}
dma(char *s)
{
len=strlen(s);
c=new char[len+1];
strcpy(c,s);
}
void join(dma &a,dma &b)
{
    len=a.len+b.len;
     delete c;
c=new char[len+1];
strcpy(c,a.c);
strcpyy(c,b.c);
}
void show()
{
    cout<<c<<endl;
}

};

int main()

{
dma d1("Engineers are"),d2("creatures of logic"),d3;
d3.join(d1,d2);
d3.show();
return 0;
